## How to
### 1. Export and Import VM
If we want to move our project into another PC or we want to send it to other person we can't just copy and paste our project folder. If we do it this way some important file may not be copied. It's better if we export the file into .ova extention and we can import it in another virtual machine.

<img src="export.png" alt="Export" title="Export" width="900" />

> open File > Export Applience... and choose which virtual machine that you want to export

<br>

<img src="export2.png" alt="Export" title="Export" width="900" />

> You can set where to save the file by clicking the folder icon. In MAC Address Policy you can decide which network adapter that you want to include. After your file have already exported, you will find ".ova" extention file.

<br>

<img src="import.png" alt="import" title="import" width="900" />

> open File > Import Appliance... to import the file

<br>

<img src="openfile.png" alt="import" title="import" width="900" />

> choose the ".ova" file to import it into your project
