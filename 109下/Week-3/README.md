## How to
### 1. Set up SSH passwordless login
First we need to generating a new SSH key pair by type the following command.
```
$ssh-keygen
```
Press enter to accept saving the file in the default folder
```
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa):
```
Next you will be asked whether you want to add passphrase or not. This passphrase will let you have an extra layer of security.
```
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/yourusername/.ssh/id_rsa):
```
The process would looks like this :

Next cd to your id_rsa file, the folder path are written at the above line just like the picture above. Make sure that the SSH key are generated by type the following command :

<img src="ls.PNG" alt="ls" title="ls" width="500" />

Now that the SSH key has already been generated, to set up a passwordless login we need to copy the public key into the server that we want to manage. The following command should copy your id into the server.
```
ssh-copy-id remote_username@server_IPaddress
```
next you need to input the password and then relogin into the server.

Now you should be able to login to the server without being prompted to fill in the password.
